Servant is a really nice library for building REST APIs in Haskell.  However,
it uses some advanced GHC features which may not be familiar to some Haskell
programmers.  In this article, I explain type-level strings, type-level lists,
type-level operators, and type families.  Finally, I use code from
servant-server to explain how these features are used in practice.

Servant Example
---------------

Here is a simple example of using servant-server.

```
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}

module Main where

import Control.Monad.Trans.Either (EitherT)
import Network.Wai (Application)
import Network.Wai.Handler.Warp (run)
import Network.Wai.Middleware.RequestLogger (logStdoutDev)
import Servant
    ( (:>), (:<|>)((:<|>)), Get, JSON, Proxy(..), ServantErr, ServerT, serve )

type MyAPI = "dogs" :> Get '[JSON] [Int]
        :<|> "cats" :> Get '[JSON] [String]

app :: Application
app = serve (Proxy :: Proxy MyAPI) myAPI

myAPI :: ServerT MyAPI (EitherT ServantErr IO)
myAPI = dogNums :<|> cats

dogNums :: EitherT ServantErr IO [Int]
dogNums = return [1,2,3,4]

cats :: EitherT ServantErr IO [String]
cats = return ["long-haired", "short-haired"]

main :: IO ()
main = run 32323 $ logStdoutDev app
```

This example project can be found at the gist https://gist.github.com/cdepillabout/c2b8b1807e1f571fdb45#file-example-hs

The following steps can be used to download and run the code.  The stack build tool is used.

```
$ git clone https://gist.github.com/c2b8b1807e1f571fdb45.git
$ mv c2b8b1807e1f571fdb45 small-servant-example
$ cd small-servant-example
$ stack build
$ stack exec servant-notes
```

This runs a Warp server on port 32323.  With the server running, you can use curl to test the API.

```
$ curl http://localhost:32323/dogs
[1,2,3,4]
$ curl http://localhost:32323/cats
["long-haired","short-haired"]
$
```

You can also open the code in ghci.

```
$ stack ghci
ghci> :load example.hs
ghci> :info app
app :: Application      -- Defined at example.hs:17:1
ghci>
```

Type-Level Strings
------------------

Recent versions of GHC support [type-level strings](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.10.1/docs/html/users_guide/type-level-literals.html).  What's a type-level string?  Well, let's play around with it in the REPL.

First, we need to enable the DataKinds language extension.

```
ghci> :set -XDataKinds
ghci>
```

Now, let's try to get the kind of a type-level string:

```
ghci> :kind "hello"
"hello" :: GHC.TypeLits.Symbol
ghci>
```

Hmm, our type-level string appears to be of kind [GHC.TypeLits.Symbol](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.0.0/docs/GHC-TypeLits.html#t:Symbol).  So what can we do with this?

Looking at the [GHC.TypeLits.symbolVal](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.0.0/docs/GHC-TypeLits.html#v:symbolVal) function, it looks like we can get back the <i>value</i> of our type-level string.

Let's take a look at this in ghci.  First we need to import GHC.TypeLits.symbolVal, and then import Data.Proxy.Proxy, We will be using Proxy to "proxy" the type-level literal.

```
ghci> import GHC.TypeLits
ghci> import Data.Proxy
ghci> symbolVal (Proxy :: Proxy "hello")
"hello"
ghci>
```

This is really cool!  We are able to get back a <i>concrete value</i> of something that only exists on the <i>type-level</i>!

How does servant use this?  Take a look at the MyAPI we defined near the top of this article:

```
type MyAPI = "dogs" :> Get '[JSON] [Int]
        :<|> "cats" :> Get '[JSON] [String]
```

"dogs" and "cats" are type-level strings.  At the end of this article we will look at some servant-server code and see that it is using symbolVal to get the value of the type-level strings.

Type-Level Lists
----------------

Just like we can have type-level strings, we can also have type-level lists.

Just like with type-level strings, we need to enable the DataKinds language extension.

```
ghci> :set -XDataKinds
ghci>
```

Let's look at the kind of a type-level empty list:

```
ghci> :kind! []
[] :: * -> *
ghci>
```

No, wait, that's not right.  That's just the kind of the normal list construtor.  How do we write a type-level list?

Take quick peek at the GHC page on [datatype
promotion](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.10.1/docs/html/users_guide/promotion.html).
The first section is pretty interesting, as is the section on the [promoted
list and tuple
types](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.10.1/docs/html/users_guide/promotion.html#promoted-lists-and-tuples).
There is a short example of a heterogeneous list (or HList).  A heterogeneous list is a list that has elements of different types.  In the example in Promoted List and Tuple section, you can see that foo2 represents a heterogeneous list with two elements, Int and Bool.

Looking at this example, we see that we can define type-level lists by putting a quote in front of the opening bracket in the list:

```
ghci> :kind! '[]
'[] :: [k]
ghci>
```

We can also define type level lists with multiple elements:

```
ghci> :kind! '[Int, Bool, String]
'[Int, Bool, String] :: [*]
ghci>
```

Going back to the MyAPI example from above, we can see that servant is using type-level lists to represent the available content type encodings of the response.

```
type MyAPI = "dogs" :> Get <b>'[JSON]</b> [Int]
        :<|> "cats" :> Get <b>'[JSON]</b> [String]
```

Servant is only willing to send back responses in JSON.

Additional content types could also be specified:

```
type MyAPI = "dogs" :> Get <b>'[JSON, FormUrlEncoded]</b> [Int]
        :<|> "cats" :> Get <b>'[JSON, PlainText]</b> Text
```

(However, to get this to compile, we would need to have an instance of ToFormUrlEncoded [Int].)

I'm not going to go into how type-level lists are used in servant-server, but
if you're interested you may want to start with reading the [Get instance for
HasServer](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/blob/31b12d4bf468b9fd46f5c4b797f8ef11d0894aba/servant-server/src/Servant/Server/Internal.hs#L230),
which will take you to the
[methodRouter](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/blob/31b12d4bf468b9fd46f5c4b797f8ef11d0894aba/servant-server/src/Servant/Server/Internal.hs#L123)
function, which will take you to the
[AllCTRender](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/blob/31b12d4bf468b9fd46f5c4b797f8ef11d0894aba/servant/src/Servant/API/ContentTypes.hs#L158)
type class.


Type-Level Operators
--------------------

In the servant example code above, there are two type-level operators being
used: (:>) and (:<|>).  Type-level operators are similar to normal data types.
They are just composed of symbols instead of letters.

Let's look at how (:>) and (:<|>) are defined in servant:

```
data path :> a

data a :<|> b = a :<|> b
```

If we didn't want to write them infix, we could write them like this:

```
data (:>) path a

data (:<|>) a b = (:<|>) a b
```

In fact, if we were to write these data types with letters instead of symbols,
it would look something like this:

```
data Foo path a

data Bar a b = Bar a b
```

You can see that (:>) and (:<|>) are just normal datatype definitions. They
look weird because they are made of symbols and written infix.

Type operators help us write long type definitions that are easy to understand.
Take the following API definition:

```
type MyAPI = "foo" :> "bar" >: Get '[JSON] [Int]
```

Rewriting this prefix would look like this:

```
type MyAPI = (:>) "foo" ((>:) "bar" (Get '[JSON] [Int]))
```

You can see how much easier the infix style is to read!

NOTE:  You need the TypeOperators language extension enabled to use the above code.

https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/data-type-extensions.html#type-operators

You may be thinking, "These type operators are pretty neat, but how are they
actually used?  They just look like confusing data types!"  Well, we'll get to
that in a minute.  First  we need to take a look at type families.

Type Families
-------------

Type families are a relatively simple addition to Haskell that allow the user to do some computation at the type level.  However, if you google for "type families" (TODO: link to google here), it's easy to get scared.

https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=haskell+type+families&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=OzuSVZSMA6S-mAX044aoCQ

The first result is the GHC/Type families article on the Haskell wiki (https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Type_families).  This is written with an advanced Haskeller in mind.  Don't worry if it goes completely over your head.  (The other problem is that most of their examples use data families instead of type families--which I introduce below.  Most of the realworld Haskell code I've seen uses type families much more than data families).

The second link is to the GHC manual.  It's good if you already know about type families and just want a refresher, but it's not good if you just an introduction to type families.  https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/type-families.html

The third result is https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/pick-of-the-week/type-families-and-pokemon an article on fpcomplete.  It gets points for being about Pokemon, but the setup/motivation for using type families is way too long.

The fourth result is an introduction to type families from O'Charles (https://ocharles.org.uk/blog/posts/2014-12-12-type-families.html).  It's the best of the bunch, but it is slightly hard to follow if you've never used MVars, IORefs, etc.

I wrote a super simple tl;dr presentation about type families.  https://cdepillabout.github.io/haskell-type-families-presentation
Originally I wrote it in Japanese for a Haskell Lightening Talk in Tokyo, but I recently translated it to English upon the request from someone in the #haskell room in the functional programming slack community (http://fpchat.com/).  If you aren't sure about type families, please read that presentation and then proceed to the next section.  We will be talking about the ServantT type familiy.


Servant
-------

So now we come to how servant actually uses these things.  Let's go back to the example code at the top of this blog post:


```
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}

module Main where

import Control.Monad.Trans.Either (EitherT)
import Network.Wai (Application)
import Network.Wai.Handler.Warp (run)
import Network.Wai.Middleware.RequestLogger (logStdoutDev)
import Servant
    ( (:>), (:<|>)((:<|>)), Get, JSON, Proxy(..), ServantErr, ServerT, serve )

type MyAPI = "dogs" :> Get '[JSON] [Int]
        :<|> "cats" :> Get '[JSON] [String]

app :: Application
app = serve (Proxy :: Proxy MyAPI) myAPI

myAPI :: ServerT MyAPI (EitherT ServantErr IO)
myAPI = dogNums :<|> cats

dogNums :: EitherT ServantErr IO [Int]
dogNums = return [1,2,3,4]

cats :: EitherT ServantErr IO [String]
cats = return ["long-haired", "short-haired"]

main :: IO ()
main = run 32323 $ logStdoutDev app
```

The two interesting functions are serve and myAPI.  serve is provided by servant-server, while myAPI is written by us.

Let's look at the type of serve:

```
ghci> import Servant.Server
ghci> :type serve
serve :: HasServer layout => Proxy layout
						  -> Server layout
						  -> Network.Wai.Application 
```

Let's start with the easy things.  You can see that it returns a 'Network.Wai.Application'.  This represents an application that can that can be served by Warp (i.e. something that can be passed to the 'run' function).

The first argument is Proxy layout.  This is how we tell the serve function what our API type is.  You might be asking, "If we are also passing the layout type variable to the Server type constructor, why do we additionally need to pass a Proxy layout?  Surely, we don't need to pass it twice?".  That will be covered later.

(If you don't understand this, look at the type of the serve function again:

```
serve :: HasServer layout => Proxy <b>layout</b>
						  -> Server </b>layout</b>
						  -> Network.Wai.Application 
```

layout is specified twice, when it should only have to be specified once, right?)

Now look at the second argument, Server layout.  What is Server?

```
ghci> :info Server
type Server layout =
	ServerT layout (EitherT ServantErr IO)
```

Server looks like it is a specialization of ServerT around the EitherT monad transformer.  This similar to how the Reader monad is a specialization of the ReaderT monad:

```
newtype ReaderT r m a = ...
type Reader r a = ReaderT r Identity a
```

Okay, so Server is just a specialization of ServerT.  So then what is ServerT?

```
ghci> :info! Server
class HasServer (layout :: k) where                                                                                                              type family ServerT (layout :: k) (m :: * -> *) :: *
...
```

...a type family!  This is what we've been waiting for!  ServerT is a type family.  It's a function that computes a type.  Let's take a look at the HasServer type class before really diving into ServerT.
